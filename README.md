# âœ¨ Hiya! 

## :speech_balloon: about me 
My name is Oliver (aco works great as well), and I enjoy using programming both as a tool to solve everyday problems and as a form of personal expression

## :open_book: currently learning
Web stuff, mainly React and noSQL DBs.

## :thought_balloon: wanting to learn
Working with ML in Python through for example TensorFlow is a long term goal of mine, as well as learning PyGame and generally working more with Python. Learning a lower level language for system software would be cool at some point, but we'll get there when we get there :sweat_smile:
